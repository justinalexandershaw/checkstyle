Because there are two versions of most checks, we have to turn on and 
turn off each version based on the name of the file we are checking.
We do that by suppressing checks based on a regex filename matcher.
For example, the "BlankLineBeforeMethod" check starts counting as a
deduction in HW3, starts being marked as -0 in HW2, and should not be
mentioned at all in HW1. The following table helps describe how we will
achieve this suppression matrix:

    Homework #      HW1         HW2 (-0)    HW3 (-1)
    CheckError      suppress    suppress    show
    CheckWarning    suppress    show        suppress

Note that we never want to show both versions of the check for any given
filename. Therefore, it is not enough to just suppress checks on certain
homework files, we actually need to make sure that if one regex matches
then the other regex will not match. We do this by using negative
look-behinds.

By default, CheckError should be un-suppressed, and should only become
suppressed for the homework files where it is irrelevant. Conversely,
the CheckWarning should be suppressed by default, and should only become
un-suppressed for the homework where it is marked as a -0 (one week before
it starts being marked as a regular deduction). Therefore, we might see
a suppression that models this behavior like the following, where the first
line will suppress CheckError for either HW1.java or HW2.java and the
second line will suppress CheckWarning for files not named HW2.java. Take
a look at the example below:

    <suppress id="CheckError" files="(HW1|HW2)\.java"/>
    <suppress id="CheckWarning" files="(?<!HW2)\.java"/>

Clearly, different professors will use different homework file names, so
we compiled a list of common ones used by common professors. This should
be a fairly exhaustive list, but if you see one that is missing please
update the list. Note that '-' means the professor uses the same name as
a program already named in that given row

    Homework    Stuart              Brett
    HW1         Song                -
    HW2         DrawRocket          SpaceNeedle
    HW3         CafeWall            -
    HW4         Admit               Budgeter
    HW5         Guess               GuessingGame
    HW6         Names               MadLibs
    HW7         Personality         -
    HW8         Bear, Lion, Giant, FlyTrap, Food, Cat, Dog, Pigeon, LabTA
                Ant, Bird, Vulture, Hippo, Rabbit, Frog, Elephant
